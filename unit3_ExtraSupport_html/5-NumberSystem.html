There are 4 types of Number System 
1. Decimal => base 10 (all number we see and know is decimal and it is called base 10) 
why we called base 10 ? 
because total number have 10 like 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9

2. Binary(main) => base 2 (it have 0 and 1. Computer just only know 0 and 1, our cpu (instruction)is understand only 0 and 1)
our html codes all write or change to be 0 and 1
(translator, compiler, JVM, virtual machine (=interpreted language, interpreter) will change to be 0 and 1)

3. Octal => base 8 (like 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7)

4.Hexa  (frequently use)=> base 16 (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F)
(if we want to save something in memory, their memory address is expressed with Hexa decimal value to us
In later program Sir will teach by debugging about Hexa to know more detailed
)

if you want express 10 with Hexa system, it will show only A 
10 => A
11 => B 
AB 10,11

A  = 65 Decimal

2 ｜_65        1
2  |_32        0
2   |_16       0
2    |_8       0
2     |_4      0
2      |_2     0
2        1 

1000001  =>add front 0 to be 7 to 8 bit 01000001
※ 0 cannot add at the end

human write A but computer understand 01000001

utf-8 is perform each charactor like above encode system

learning method => search google or youtube(arithmetic in number system => +,-,*,/)

if you finished +.-.*,/ calculating each other +-*/, you are accomplished number system knowledge
beginner take 2 days or 3 days to calculate
